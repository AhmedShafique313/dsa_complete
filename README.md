# Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Complete Codes of Data Structures and Algorithms Labs by Ahmed Shafique

This Repository is used to help others to find data structures and algorithms codes in signle repository. I am GitHub open source contributer contributing my all C/C++ Codes related to DSA in single repository. 

## Codes related to DSA are mentioned in following sequences of labs
All labs containing codes that are very helpful for doing DSA in C++ programming. I mentioned all the codes and purpose with their lab section number. If you find any difficulty comment me a issue.

* LAB Number 1
