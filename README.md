# Data Structures and Algorithms 

### Complete Codes of Data Structures and Algorithms Labs by Ahmed Shafique

This Repository is used to help others to find data structures and algorithms codes in signle repository. I am GitHub open source contributer contributing my all C/C++ Codes related to DSA in single repository. ‚ú®

### Codes related to DSA are mentioned in following sequences of labs
All labs containing codes that are very helpful for doing DSA in C++ programming. I mentioned all the codes and purpose with their lab section number. If you find any difficulty comment me a issue. üëè


This lab is based on Functions and Structures. All codes are below.

### How to use them ü§î
* Step:01 Fork the repository 
* Step:02 Clone into your pc/laptop using vs code or git
* Step:03 edit and then again push into your repository

### Lab 1 & 2
* Arthmatic Series
