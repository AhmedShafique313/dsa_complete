# Data Structures and Algorithms & OOP

### Complete Codes of Data Structures and Algorithms & OOP Codes by Ahmed Shafique

This Repository is used to help others to find data structures and algorithms codes in signle repository. I am GitHub open source contributer contributing my all C/C++ Codes related to DSA & OOP in single repository. ‚ú®

### Codes related to DSA are mentioned in following sequences of labs
All labs containing codes that are very helpful for doing DSA & OOP in C++ programming. I mentioned all the codes and purpose with their lab section number. If you find any difficulty comment me a issue. üëè


This lab is based on Functions and Structures. All codes are below. I studed DSA from `Dr. Bilal Wajid`, He is in top 3 Data Scientist in Pakistan.

# OOP
Instructor Dr. Haris. I am just improving my grades in DSA so that's why I am making all these stuffs to help others because I am open source contributer.
